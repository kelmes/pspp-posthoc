PSPP version 0.7
================

This module provides an interface allowing perl programs to create pspp 
system files.

INSTALLATION

To install you must have first installed and built pspp 0.7.2 or
later.  The Perl module does not use the installed PSPP binaries, but
it does require the libpspp-core-$VERSION.so library installed with
PSPP (see below).

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
   make test

For "make test" to succeed, Perl must be able to find
libpspp-core-$VERSION.so.  It can do so if "make install" has been run
(as shown above), or if LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to it (e.g. in
src/.libs).  Running "make check" from the top-level build directory
will automatically set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the POSIX module.

The modules Test::More, Text::Diff, File::Temp and the pspp source are
required during installation, but are not needed to run the module.
