* Changes for patchlevel 115:

** New output driver initialization interface. 

*** Changed option syntax.

`-o driver' is the new syntax.  The default driver is named `default'.

*** The initialization file `output' has been renamed `devices'.

*** Driver names actually specify categories.

Each driver name specified can actually result in 0, 1, 2, or any
greater number of actual drivers being used, depending solely on the
contents of the `devices' output initialization file.

*** The driver initialization file is read in a `termcap'-like manner.

That is, it determines whether to use a driver based on the parameters
passed to it, rather than mainly on the contents of the `devices' file
plus some goofy hacks with command-line options.

*** Macros defined in the `devices' file can be overridden.

Do it by specifying a definition on the command line of form
`KEY=VALUE'.  See `devices' for details.

** Short form of option `--verbose' changed to `-V'.

** New option `-v' or `--verbose'.

`-v' causes PSPP to display more info about what it's doing.
Multiple `-v's display even more.

** Support for small 25-line screens. 

The ASCII driver minimum for page length is now 15 lines instead of
29.

* Changes for patchlevel 114:

** Rich text now supported in the ascii driver.

The style changes are done with overstriking or with defined
sequences.

** New ascii output driver option `carriage-return-style'.

This can be set to `cr' or to `bs', depending on whether returning to
the left margin should be done with an ASCII CR or with multiple
backspaces.

* Changes for patchlevel 113:

** Table titles are more complete.

Now they include a description of the table contents.

* Changes for patchlevel 112:

** Tables now are preceded by a descriptive `title'.

This line shows what procedure emitted it, etc.

** Some tables are now divided into multiple columns.

These columns are displayed across the page in order to save vertical
space.

* Changes for patchlevel 111:

** Bugfixes.

* Changes for patchlevel 110:

** `stat' has now been renamed `Fiasco', for `Fiasco Implements
Accurate Statistical COmputations'!  Let's all celebrate the clever
acronym!

** Bugfixes.

* Changes for patchlevel 109:

** Bugfixes.
